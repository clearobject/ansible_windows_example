Documentation is desperately needed in many areas.
Extra setup is required on both the control and the client
- Intalling Python
- Enabling remote powershell / winrm with a special script
- Installing extra modules for control system
There is NO method of privilege escalation. You must connect as an admin for the system.
The windows modules are all completely separate from the existing modules.
- Cannot dynamically load for OS. If windows, needs its own complete set of steps.
- Very limited compared to linux
- Refactoring is almost impossible. Adding a step to a config would require a change in two places.
So many escaped paths :(
